# CS495_PythonWebProject
A simple web based project which surpasses the minimum requirements for the CS495 Python Web Project.

1. Ensure that you have installed Python Flask on your local system
2. Use python to run main.py from the command line
3. Do not separate or re-locate any of the files in the file-system
4. Go to 127.0.0.1:5000
5. Enjoy

Note: requires python Flask, programmed and compiled on python 3.10

Yes I do realize this fulfills the requirements for Challenge Problem #1; however, I have different plans for that either in the form of implementing AJAX or by doing the project in a programming language which is completely new to me.
